# Objective:
Practicing React Concepts such as React-Router-DOM v6, UseRoutes, UseContext, UseState and UseNaviagtion hooks

- I want to create a quiz app where a user can answer the questions and you can store the answers with next and previous buttons and final score should be displayed.

- I want to use this as my scribbling pad so whatever you see here is crappy, unrefined and unoptimised code. You have been warned.

## Firstly, I want to start by creating question components.
