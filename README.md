# Objective:
Practicing React Concepts such as React-Router-DOM v6, UseRoutes, UseContext, UseState and UseNaviagtion hooks

- I want to create meetup list app where I can create and add a meetup to favorites.

- I want to use this as my scribbling pad so whatever you see here is crappy, unrefined and unoptimised code. You have been warned

## Firstly, I would like to create a Navbar
- using react-router to navigate the page
- In versions greater than React-routerV6.0 We have to wrap the BrowserHistory around App in index js component
- It's better to make use of useRoutes hook.

## Learn the differences between using useRoutes and traditional <Routes><Route><Url> kind of syntax

## Use context for state management
